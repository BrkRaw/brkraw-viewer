# Config

The Config tab keeps **viewer defaults in one place** so teams can align on
layout and registry preferences without editing YAML by hand.

## Common settings

- Viewer display options
- Column layout for registry tables
- Conversion layout defaults

Changes are written to `config.yaml` and applied at the next load.
