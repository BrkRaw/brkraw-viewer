# Viewer

The Viewer tab is a fast, low-friction space for **visual QC and orientation checks**
without committing to a conversion. It exists so researchers can confirm that a
scan is the right one and oriented correctly before running a workflow.

This fits the brkraw philosophy by keeping the viewer lightweight while leaning
on the same BrkRaw loaders and orientation logic used by the CLI.

## Loading data

Use the Load button to open:

- Study folders
- Zip archives
- PvDatasets packages

The selected scan and reconstruction control what is shown in the viewport.

For a shared or external registry file, launch with:

`brkraw viewer --registry /path/to/registry.jsonl`

## Controls

- **Space**: raw, scanner, or subject RAS
- **Subject type / pose**: manual orientation selection when viewing subject RAS
- **Flip**: per-axis visual flip for quick inspection
- **Crosshair**: toggle center crosshair
- **Zoom**: scale the view

## Registry

Open the registry window from the toolbar to browse registered datasets, add or
remove entries, and load directly into the viewer. Use **Current session** in the
`+` menu to add whatever is currently loaded; it is disabled until a dataset is
open.
