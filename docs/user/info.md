# Info

The Info tab exists to **explain what the viewer is showing**: it resolves
Bruker parameter files into a human-readable summary so you can validate scan
choices before conversion.

## What you can do

- Browse study and scan metadata
- Inspect derived values (protocol, dimensions, timings)
- Copy information for reports or QA

Info uses the currently selected scan and reconstruction in the Viewer tab.
