# Addon & Params

The **Addon** tab lets you inspect and apply BrkRaw rule/spec assets inside the
viewer. It resolves selected info specs and context maps to show a readable
summary for the active scan/reco, and it surfaces the rule/spec status that was
applied.

The **Params** tab provides a searchable view of raw Bruker parameters plus a
scan summary panel for quick checks.

## What you can do

- Review rule + spec selection status and resolved info output
- Apply info specs and context maps without leaving the UI
- Search parameter files (`acqp`, `method`, `reco`, `visu_pars`)
- Use the scan summary panel to confirm protocol and acquisition details

Addon/Params always reflect the currently selected scan and reconstruction in
the Viewer tab.
